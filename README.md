Start on the odin project with rock paper scissors play in the console log. Gonna be interesting to see what i´ve learned so far.

I forgot to update the parts between in the README.md file.

It got the final part of the program to work, so theres a human input (humanPlay) and a random computer play(computerPlay) which each of them returns a value, rock=1, paper=2, scissors=3. 
I´ve then made a playRound fnc that takes the return value and made 3 conditions which when reached, returns a value and a console log. tie, win and lose.
After made a game fnc that takes the retun value from playRound and gives human or robort a score. Played the playRound fnc 5 times with the conditions following each func and declares a winner when the 5 rounds have ended.
